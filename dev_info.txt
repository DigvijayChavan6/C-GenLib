The improvment we have to done in the project

stack  :: ✔️  Everything is done inside stack.  

queue  :: ✔️  Everything is done inside stack.  

dqueue::
        dqueue_push_front();
        dqueue_push_back();
        dqueue_pop_front();
        dqueue_pop_back();
        dqueue_isempty();
        dqueue_size();
        dqueue_clean();
        dqueue_reverse();
        dqueue_ispresent() 

        In dqueue data structure we can implemented the above functions 

    improvment we have to done:
            1) We have to improve the dqueue_clean() functions
            3) We have to implement the dqueue_swap() function
            

     //If any improvment is there the add the improvments on that add the functionality on the
       files and please commit the changes on bug.txt file at the time of any change the mention 
       the change in these file or disscus with team members (add the changes in below section and the improvments in improvments section)
