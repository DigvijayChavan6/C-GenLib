The improvment we have to done in the project

stack  ::
        stack_create();
        stack_push();
        stack_pop();
        stack_peek();
        stack_isempty();
        stack_clean();

        In stack data structure we can implemented the above functions 
    
    improvment we have to done:
        1) We have to improve the stack_clean() functions
        2) we have to implement the stack_ispresent() function
        3) we have to implement the stack_swap() function

    //If any improvment is there the add the improvments on that add the functionality on the
       files and please commit the changes on bug.txt file at the time of any change the mention 
       the change in these file or disscus with team members (add the changes in below section and the improvments in improvments section)
